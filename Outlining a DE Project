Question: Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; where would you start? How would you go about gathering requirements?

I would start by asking stakeholders to explain their vision for data analytics for their organization. What are their business needs
and how do they hope to use data to address it? Do they already have the necessary raw data, and, if not, is it obtainable? What are some
questions you hope to answer? Are they static questions that can be answered now or are they questions whose answers change frequently
and require constantly updating data? Another important consideration is the amount of data and how fast they would like their data
analytics program to be. Do they have the computational capacity to handle it?
