Q8: The market share for a given nation within a given region is defined as the fraction of the revenue, the sum of [l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)], 
from the products of a specified type in that region that was supplied by suppli- ers from the given nation. The query determines this for the years 1995 
and 1996 presented in this order.

select
    o_year,
    sum(case
            when nation = 'BRAZIL'
            then volume
            else 0 end) / sum(volume) as market_share
from (
    select strftime('%Y', o_orderdate) as o_year,
        l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount) as volume,
        n_name as nation
    from
        orders,
        lineitem,
        supplier, 
        part, 
        nation,

        l_suppkey = s_suppkey
        and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
        and n_regionkey = r_regionkey

Q9: The Product Type Profit Measure Query finds, for each nation and each year, the profit for all parts ordered in that year that contain a specified substring 
in their names and that were filled by a supplier in that nation. The profit is defined as the sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)] 
for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the year and profit 
in descending order by year (most recent first).

select
    o_year, 
    n_name, 
    sum(prof_single) as profit
from 
    (
        select 
            strftime('%Y', o_orderdate) as o_year,
            (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity) as prof_single,
            n_name
        from 
            orders,
            lineitem,
            supplier,
            nation,
            partsupp,
            part
        where 
            p_name like '%green%'
            and s_suppkey = l_suppkey
            and ps_suppkey = l_suppkey
            and ps_partkey = l_partkey
            and p_partkey = l_partkey
            and o_orderkey = l_orderkey

Q10: The Returned Item Reporting Query finds the top 20 customers, in terms of their effect on lost revenue for a given quarter, who 
have returned parts. The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's name, 
address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of 
lost revenue. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems.

select 
    c_name,
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)) as lost_revenue
from
    lineitem,
    customer,
    orders
where
    l_orderkey = o_orderkey
    and o_custkey = c_custkey
    and l_returnflag = 'R'
    and o_orderdate >= '1993-10-01'
    and o_orderdate < '1994-01-01'
group by
    c_custkey
order by
    lost_revenue desc
limit 20;

Q11: The Important Stock Identification Query finds, from scanning the available stock of suppliers in a given nation, all the parts 
that represent a significant percentage of the total value of all available parts. The query displays the part number and the value 
of those parts in descending order of value.

select
    ps_partkey,
    sum(ps_availqty * ps_supplycost) as avail_money
from 
    supplier,
    partsupp,
    nation
where
    s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
    and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
    and n_name = 'GERMANY'
group by
    ps_partkey having
        sum(ps_availqty * ps_supplycost) > (
            select sum(ps_availqty * ps_supplycost) * .0001
            from supplier, nation, partsupp
            where s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
                and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
                and n_name = 'GERMANY'
        )
order by 
    avail_money desc

Q12: The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode, for lineitems actually received by customers in a given year, 
the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for two different specified ship 
modes. Only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are con- sidered. The late lineitems are partitioned into 
two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH.
