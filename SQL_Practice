Q8: The market share for a given nation within a given region is defined as the fraction of the revenue, the sum of [l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)], 
from the products of a specified type in that region that was supplied by suppli- ers from the given nation. The query determines this for the years 1995 
and 1996 presented in this order.

select
    o_year,
    sum(case
            when nation = 'BRAZIL'
            then volume
            else 0 end) / sum(volume) as market_share
from (

Q9: The Product Type Profit Measure Query finds, for each nation and each year, the profit for all parts ordered in that year that contain a specified substring 
in their names and that were filled by a supplier in that nation. The profit is defined as the sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)] 
for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the year and profit 
in descending order by year (most recent first).

select
    o_year, 
    n_name, 
    sum(prof_single) as profit
from

            and ps_partkey = l_partkey
            and p_partkey = l_partkey

Q10: The Returned Item Reporting Query finds the top 20 customers, in terms of their effect on lost revenue for a given quarter, who 
have returned parts. The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's name, 
address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of 
lost revenue. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems.

select 
    c_name,
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)) as lost_revenue
from
    lineitem,
    customer,
    orders
where
    l_orderkey = o_orderkey
    and o_custkey = c_custkey
    and l_returnflag = 'R'
    and o_orderdate >= '1993-10-01'
    and o_orderdate < '1994-01-01'
group by
    c_custkey
order by
    lost_revenue desc
limit 20;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q11: The Important Stock Identification Query finds, from scanning the available stock of suppliers in a given nation, all the parts 
that represent a significant percentage of the total value of all available parts. The query displays the part number and the value 
of those parts in descending order of value.

select
    ps_partkey,
    sum(ps_availqty * ps_supplycost) as avail_money
from 
    supplier,
    partsupp,
    nation
where
    s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
    and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
    and n_name = 'GERMANY'
group by
    ps_partkey having
        sum(ps_availqty * ps_supplycost) > (
            select sum(ps_availqty * ps_supplycost) * .0001
            from supplier, nation, partsupp
            where s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
                and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
                and n_name = 'GERMANY'
        )
order by 
    avail_money desc

Q12: The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode, for lineitems actually received by customers in a given year, 
the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for two different specified ship 
modes. Only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are con- sidered. The late lineitems are partitioned into 
two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH.

select 
    l_shipmode,
    sum(case
        when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH'
            then 1
            else 0
        end) as high_count,
    sum(case
        when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH'
            then 0
            else 1
        end) as low_count
from
    lineitem,
    orders
where 
    l_orderkey = o_orderkey
    and strftime('%Y', l_receiptdate) = '1994'
    and l_shipdate < l_commitdate
    and l_receiptdate > l_commitdate
    and l_shipmode in ('SHIP', 'MAIL')
group by 
    l_shipmode

Q13: This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record 
of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to 
ensure that the orders counted do not fall into one of several special categories of orders. Special categories are identified in the 
order comment column by looking for a particular pattern.

select
    num_orders,
    count(*) as count
from
    (
        select count(*) as num_orders
        from customer left outer join orders
            on c_custkey = o_custkey
            and o_comment not like '%special%requests%'
        group by c_custkey
    )
group by
    num_orders
order by num_orders 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q14: The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue in a given year and month was derived from promotional parts.
The query considers only parts actually shipped in that month and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as 
(l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).

select 
    100.0 * sum(l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)) / total_revenue as rev_fraction
from 
    (select 
        sum(l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)) as total_revenue
    from 
        lineitem,
        part
    where 
        l_partkey = p_partkey
        and l_shipdate >= '1995-09-01'
        and l_shipdate < '1995-10-01'
    ) as total_rev_table,
    lineitem,
    part
where       
    p_partkey = l_partkey
    and p_type like 'PROMO%'
    and l_shipdate >= '1995-09-01'
    and l_shipdate < '1995-10-01'
