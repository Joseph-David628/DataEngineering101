Q8: The market share for a given nation within a given region is defined as the fraction of the revenue, the sum of [l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)], 
from the products of a specified type in that region that was supplied by suppli- ers from the given nation. The query determines this for the years 1995 
and 1996 presented in this order.

Q9: The Product Type Profit Measure Query finds, for each nation and each year, the profit for all parts ordered in that year that contain a specified substring 
in their names and that were filled by a supplier in that nation. The profit is defined as the sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)] 
for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the year and profit 
in descending order by year (most recent first).

Q10: The Returned Item Reporting Query finds the top 20 customers, in terms of their effect on lost revenue for a given quarter, who 
have returned parts. The query considers only parts that were ordered in the specified quarter. The query lists the customer's name, 
address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of 
lost revenue. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems.

select 
    c_name,
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)) as lost_revenue
from

Q11: The Important Stock Identification Query finds, from scanning the available stock of suppliers in a given nation, all the parts 
that represent a significant percentage of the total value of all available parts. The query displays the part number and the value 
of those parts in descending order of value.

Q12: The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode, for lineitems actually received by customers in a given year, 
the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for two different specified ship 
modes. Only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate are con- sidered. The late lineitems are partitioned into 
two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH.

select 
    l_shipmode,
    sum(case
        when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH'

Q13: This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, including customers who have no record 
of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to 
ensure that the orders counted do not fall into one of several special categories of orders. Special categories are identified in the 
order comment column by looking for a particular pattern.

select
    num_orders,
    count(*) as count
from
    (
        select count(*) as num_orders
        from customer left outer join orders

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q14: The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue in a given year and month was derived from promotional parts.
The query considers only parts actually shipped in that month and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as 
(l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)).

select 
    100.0 * sum(l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)) / total_revenue as rev_fraction
from 
    (select

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q15: 
The Top Supplier Query finds the supplier who contributed the most to the overall revenue for parts shipped during a given quarter of 
a given year. In case of a tie, the query lists all suppliers whose contribution was equal to the maximum, presented in supplier number 
order.

select  
    l_suppkey,
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)) as volume

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q16: The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's 
requirements. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes as long as they are not of a given type, not of a given 
brand, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending 
count and ascending brand, type, and size.

select  
    p_type,
    p_brand,
    p_size,
    count(distinct ps_suppkey) as supplier_count

Q17: The Small-Quantity-Order Revenue Query considers parts of a given brand and with a given container type and determines the 
average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7-year data- base. What would be the average 
yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer 
taken?

select sum(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 as avg_loss
from

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q18: The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the top 100 customers who have ever placed large quantity orders. The query 
lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order.

Q19: The Discounted Revenue query finds the gross discounted revenue for all orders for three different types of parts that were 
shipped by air and delivered in person. Parts are selected based on the combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a 
range of sizes.

select 
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)) 
from 
    lineitem,
    part

Q20: The Potential Part Promotion query identifies suppliers who have an excess of a given part available; an excess is defined to be 
more than 50% of the parts like the given part that the supplier shipped in a given year for a given nation. Only parts whose names 
share a certain naming convention are considered.
